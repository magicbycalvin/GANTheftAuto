# GANTheftAuto
The purpose of this project is to generate optimal local trajectories for a self driving vehicle equipped with a front-facing camera. The trajectories are generated using a generative adversarial network (GAN) and feasibility checks are performed using an additional, specialized discriminator. The original purpose of this project is for the course ECE 5995.
